# 📘 Logic-Building-Codes-and-Notes  

This repository contains my **Assignments** on **Flowcharts** and **Java Programming**.  
It reflects the problems I solved during the initial days of learning programming and building logic step by step.  

---

## 📂 Repository Structure  

- **DAY-1** → Flowcharts and simple Java programs (positive/negative, odd/even, greetings, area calculations, largest number).  
- **DAY-2** → Conditional statements and switch-case problems (grade evaluation, leap year, days of the week, default values).  
- **DAY-3** → Methods and loops (sum of numbers, age checker, even numbers, multiplication table, menu-driven programs).  
- **DAY-4** → Arrays, strings, and pattern printing (array operations, string operations, palindrome, reverse, vowels, string pool concepts).

## 📝 What I Learned  

- How to **visualize problems with flowcharts** before coding.  
- Writing basic **Java programs** with if-else, loops, and switch-case.   
- Working with **arrays** and performing different operations on them.  
- Practicing **string operations** (reverse, palindrome, intern, equals).  
- Building **pattern printing logic** for problem-solving.  
- Understanding the basics of **JVM, JRE, JDK, and memory areas in Java**.

## 🎯 Takeaway  

These assignments helped me strengthen my **logic-building skills** and gain confidence in **Java programming basics**.  
They were not just coding exercises but small steps that improved my ability to think logically and solve problems systematically.
